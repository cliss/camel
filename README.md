"Camel" is a blogging platform written in [Node.js][n]. It is designed to be fast, simple, and lean.

# Design Goals

More specifically, the design goals were:

* Easy posting using [Markdown][m]
* Basic metadata, stored in each file
* Basic templating, with a site header/footer and post header stored separately from content
* Extremely quick performance, by caching rendered HTML output
* Support RSS

# Approach

Camel is neither a static blogging platform nor a truly dynamic one. It is a little
from column A, and a little from column B. The first time a post is loaded, it is rendered
by converting from Markdown to HTML, and then postpocessed by adding headers & footer, as well
as making metadata replacements. Upon a completed render, the resultant HTML is stored
and used from that point forward.

# Usage

## Installation

1. Install [Node][n] & [npm][npm]
2. Clone the repository
3. Get all the dependencies using NPM: `npm install`
4. `node ./camel.js`

[npm]: https://www.npmjs.org/

## Configuration

* There's a group of "statics" near the top of the file
* The parameters in the `/rss` route will need to be modified.
* The headers/footer:
    * `header.html` - site header; shown at the top of every page
    * `footer.html` - site footer; shown at the bottom of every page
    * `defaultTags.html` - default metadata; merged with page metadata (page wins)
    * `postHeader.html` - post header; shown at the top of every post not marked with `@@ HideHeader=true`. See below.
* It's worth noting there are some [Handlebars][hb] templates in use:
    * `index.md`
        * `@@ DayTemplate` - used to render a day
        * `@@ ArticlePartial` – used to render a single article in a day
        * `@@ FooterTemplate` - used to render pagination
    * `postHeader.html` - Placed on every post between the site header and post content

## Files

To use Camel, the following files are required:

    Root
      +-- camel.js
      |   Application entry point
      +-- package.json
      |   Node package file
      +-- templates/
      |     +-- defaultTags.html
      |     |   Site-level default tags, such as the site title
      |     +-- header.html
      |     |   Site header (top of every page)
      |     +-- footer.html
      |     |   Site footer (bottom of every page)
      |     `-- postHeader.html
      |         Post header (top of every post, after the site header. Handlebars template.)
      +-- public/
      |     `-- Any static files, such as images/css/javascript/etc.
      `-- posts/
          All the pages & posts are here. Pages in the root, posts ordered by day. For example:
            +-- index.md
            |   Root file; note that DayTemplate, ArticlePartial, and FooterTemplate are
            |   all Handlebars templates
            +-- about.md
            |   Sample about page
            +-- 2014/
            |   Year
            |     +-- 4/
            |     |   Month
            |     |   +-- 29/
            |     |   |   Day
            |     |   |    `-- some-blog-post.md
            |     |   `-- 30/
            |     |        +-- some-other-post.md
            |     |        `-- yet-another-post.md
            |     `-- 5/
            |         `-- 1/
            |             `-- newest-blog-post.md
            `-- etc.

For each post, metadata is specified at the top, and can be leveraged in the body. For example:

    @@ Title=Test Post
    @@ Date=2014-05 17:50

    This is a *test post* entitled "@@Title@@".

The title and date are required. Any other metadata is optional.

# Quirks

There are a couple of quirks, which don't bother me, but may bother you.

## Adding a Post

When a new post is created, if you want an instant refresh, you'll want to restart the
app in order to clear the caches. There is a commented out route `/tosscache` that will also
do this job, if you choose to enable it.

Otherwise, the internal caches will reset every 30 minutes.

Additionally, there is no mechanism within Camel for transporting a post to the `posts/`
directory. It is assumed that delivery will happen by way of a `git push` or equivalent.
That is, for example, how it would work when run on [Heroku][h].

## Pagination

Camel uses a semi-peculiar pagination model which is being referred to as "loose pagination".
Partly due to laziness, and partly because it seems better, pagination isn't strict. Rather
than always cutting off a page after N posts, instead, pagination is handled differently.

Starting with the most recent day's posts, all the posts in that day are added to a logical
page. Once that page contains N *or more* posts, that page is considered complete. The next
page is then started.

Therefore, all the posts in a single day will __always__ be on the same page. That, in turns, means
that pages will have *at least* N posts, but possibly more. In fact, a single page could have
quite a few more than N posts if, say, on one lucrative day there are 1.5*N or 2*N posts.

Pagingation is only necessary on the homepage, and page numbers are 1-based. Pages greater than
1 are loaded by passing the query string parameter p. For example, `hostname/?p=3` for page 3.

# Status

Camel is functional, and is presently running [www.caseyliss.com][c]. It could probably stand
to be cleaned up a little bit, but it is considered feature complete.
